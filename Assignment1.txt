JAVASCRIPT ASSIGNMENT-1

Ques1. Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript) ?

Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and 
interactive web content like applications and browsers.JavaScript helps the users 
to build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page 
every time.It is mainly used in web applications.


Ques2. What is the difference between client-side and server-side?


Client-side :
1. The primary function of client-side scripting is to provide 
	the requested output to the end-user. 
2. Runs on the user’s computer(Web browsers)
3. Reduces load on the server’s proccessing unit
4. Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
5. Client In client-side scripting, it does not include any interaction with the server, 
   the ony interaction done is receiving the dtata which was requested.
6. The client-side is used as the front end, where the user gets to see what we have browsed.
7. It occurs when the browser process all the codes, and then it reacts according to the 
	client’s query.
    

Server-side :
1. The primary function of server-side scripting is to manipulate and give 
	access to the required database as per request.  
2. Runs on the web server
3. Allows the server to provide dynamic websites tailored to the user. 
   Increases the processing load on server.
4. Languages used: PHP, ASP.net, Python
5. It is used to retrieve and generate content for dynamic pages.It reduces client-side 
   computation overhead.
6. The server-side is used as a back-end where data is processed and is not visible to the 
	client user. 
7. It only acts after the client initiates the browsing request.    




Ques3. What is Nodejs?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs 
on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers 
use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting — running scripts 
server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm.




Ques4 Explain Scope in JavaScript?

JavaScript has 3 types of scope:

	A. Block scope
	B. Function scope
	C. Global scope

A.	Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
	example : 
	{
	  let x = 2;
	}
	// x can NOT be used here

	/* 
	* Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
	* Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block.
	* Example
	* {
	*   var x = 2;
	* }
	* // x CAN be used here 
	*/ 

B.	Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
	They can only be accessed from within the function.

	example : 
	// code here can NOT use carName

	function myFunction() {
	  let carName = "Volvo";
	  // code here CAN use carName
	}

	// code here can NOT use carName


C.	A global variable has Global Scope:
	All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 
	
	
Ques5. JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.

JavaScript is always synchronous and single-threaded. If you're executing a JavaScript 
block of code on a page then no other JavaScript on that page will currently be executed.
JavaScript is only asynchronous in the sense that it can make, for example, Ajax calls.




Ques6. JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.
JavaScript is a single-threaded language because while running code on a single thread, 
it can be really easy to implement as we don’t have to deal with the complicated 
scenarios that arise in the multi-threaded environment like deadlock.

Ques7. Explain DOM in your own word.

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
it is the browser internal programmatic representation of the web page. and can be
manipulated by languages like JS etc changing the page without changing HTML.
